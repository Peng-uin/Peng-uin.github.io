        <h1>ATM Machine</h1>
        <p>My group and I created a Python project where it simulated an atm machine. We did encounter some difficulties though. One, there were many communincation problems between all three of us. For example, Dylan and I would be coding or trying to fix an issue, and Jacob would run the program before we were finished, creating confusion and not giving accurate information. Another example would be that it always seemed that once we fixed one or two things that were wrong with our code, three more would appear, and half the time in an entirely different area of the program, one that already worked beforehand. We ended up fixing it by perservering, talking and communicating with each other, etc. We took things slower, and in the end, that made a huge difference. One thing that I did individually was creating the while loops that controlled the login and create functions. This allowed the user to login if their account number was 1234, or create one and use that if they wished to.</p>
