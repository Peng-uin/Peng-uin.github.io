<div><p class="paragraph">Have you ever wondered what other planets are like? If there's aliens in a different galaxy? How humans are able to slowly explore and conquer our solar system? Well, I have. I would love to be part of the Jet Propulsion Labratory team, helping to feed humanity's ever growing hunger of its curiosity for space. Now, It will not be easy, let me assure you that. I plan on going to a school that focuses on enginnering, probably UC Berkeley or Stanford, and dedicating all my time there, and not giving up no matter what. I am following a long and winding path, but I believe in myself! Ever since I was a little boy, I have dreamed of space and thought to myself, I want to do that too! I began researching, and have still held true to that ambition oh so long ago to this day! </p></div>

<div><p class="paragraph">Over the years, I have really been able to grow and know myself. I found that I can work by myself and in groups equally well, and have also found that I tend to take a side role in major projects, and though I do not usually take direct role of leader, though I do occasionally. I've learned that I am a very persistent, persuasive, and ambitious. Whenever a challenge comes my way, I always find a way around it</p></div>

<div><p class="paragraph">High school has been quite unpredictble. Sometimes I never knew what I was signing up for, and took a risk! Some major accomplishments that I achieved in high school are getting a 4.67 weighted gpa, (3.87 unweighted), reaching around level 9 or close to performance level in piano (I have been playing for around 10 years or so), and achieving a 3rd dan black belt (also for about 10 years or so). I believe that these things sum up my best trait of all. Dedication. Persistence. When others quit, I power through it. And it paid off! I am very well off, and ready for whatever life throws at me next!</p></div>
